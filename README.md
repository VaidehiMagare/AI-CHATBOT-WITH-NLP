## DESCRIPTION: 

**AI CHATBOT WITH NLP – PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

**TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED:**
THE CHATBOT IS BUILT USING PYTHON AS THE CORE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) IS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE **SPACY** LIBRARY, WHICH HANDLES TEXT TOKENIZATION, LEMMATIZATION, AND STOPWORD REMOVAL. FOR FETCHING LIVE NEWS DATA, THE **NEWSAPI** PLATFORM IS INTEGRATED USING THE **REQUESTS** MODULE. ADDITIONAL UTILITIES LIKE SET INTERSECTION AND STRING MATCHING ARE USED TO IDENTIFY USER INTENT ACCURATELY.

**DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:**
THE CHATBOT IS DEVELOPED AND EXECUTED IN **GOOGLE COLAB**, A CLOUD-BASED PYTHON ENVIRONMENT THAT SUPPORTS LIBRARY INSTALLATIONS, INTERNET ACCESS FOR API CALLS, AND REAL-TIME USER INTERACTION THROUGH INPUT/OUTPUT CELLS. COLAB PROVIDES AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR TESTING NLP TASKS DUE TO ITS EASE OF USE AND NO LOCAL SETUP REQUIREMENT.

**STEPS FOLLOWED:**

1. **ENVIRONMENT SETUP:** INSTALLATION OF SPACY AND DOWNLOADING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE MODEL.
2. **DATA PREPROCESSING:** USER INPUT IS CLEANED USING SPACY – TEXT IS CONVERTED TO LOWERCASE, TOKENIZED, LEMMATIZED, AND FILTERED TO REMOVE STOPWORDS AND PUNCTUATION.
3. **INTENT MATCHING:** A KNOWLEDGE BASE IS CREATED USING A DICTIONARY OF INTENTS AND KEYWORDS. USER INPUT IS COMPARED AGAINST THIS BASE USING TOKEN INTERSECTIONS TO DETERMINE THE MOST RELEVANT RESPONSE.
4. **RESPONSE GENERATION:** THE BOT RETURNS PREDEFINED RESPONSES BASED ON THE IDENTIFIED INTENT. FOR QUERIES RELATED TO NEWS, A REAL-TIME CALL IS MADE TO THE NEWSAPI TO FETCH AND DISPLAY CURRENT HEADLINES.
5. **CHAT LOOP:** THE BOT RUNS IN A LOOP UNTIL THE USER TYPES 'EXIT' OR 'QUIT'.

**APPLICATION AREAS:**

* **CUSTOMER SUPPORT CHATBOTS** IN BANKING, RETAIL, AND EDUCATION
* **VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS** FOR WEBSITES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS
* **FAQ BOTS** TO AUTOMATE INFORMATION DELIVERY
* **INFORMATIONAL BOTS** TO PROVIDE WEATHER, NEWS, AND GENERAL KNOWLEDGE

**CONCLUSION:**
THE NLP-BASED AI CHATBOT COMBINES THE POWER OF TEXT PROCESSING (VIA SPACY) AND REAL-TIME DATA ACCESS (VIA NEWSAPI) TO INTERACT WITH USERS IN A HUMAN-LIKE MANNER. IT DEMONSTRATES A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF USER INTENT, HANDLES NATURAL LANGUAGE INPUT, AND RESPONDS ACCORDINGLY. DEVELOPED IN GOOGLE COLAB, THIS CHATBOT SERVES AS A PROTOTYPE FOR MORE ADVANCED VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED IN CUSTOMER SERVICE, EDUCATION, OR SMART HOME SYSTEMS.
